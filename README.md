# Conic Disjunctive Programs
This repository contains the numerical results for the manuscript "Convex Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programs Derived from Generalized Disjunctive Programming using Cones" by David E. Bernal and Ignacio E. Grossmann.
This manuscript can be found in arXiv, and a copy of it is available [here](Conic_GDP_arXiv.pdf).

This repository includes implementations of the different problems are performed in GAMS and are available in the [instances](/instances) directory. The results analysis is done using Coin-OR software [Paver 2.0](https://github.com/coin-or/Paver), and the formatted output can be found as an HTML website in the directory [results](/results).
